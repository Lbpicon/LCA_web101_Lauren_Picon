    <img src="../images/Lauren.jpg" id="profilePic">
    <p>I am formerly known as <i>LBrianna</i> during the prime time of dial-up internet and buddy lists. I spent a lot of time ogling computers and playing on them growing up and just recently found my way back to my first love. I've only been able to brag about my "coding" skills when MySpace was hot, but those days are over and it's time to  know what it's like to design and develop FOR REAL.</p>
    <h2><span style="background-color:goldenrod";>_Why I Do This</span></h2>
    <p>I love learning new things -- as cliche as it may sound, it's true. I can attempt coding for years and still not know enough. Coding is a jungle of forward-thinking and applying. </p>
    <h3><span style="background-color:goldenrod";>_What's next?</span></h3>
